# Web Components

Web Components should definitely be on your technology radar as software engineers and businesses battle with the quickly evolving Javascript browser landscape and the productivity of software engineers in the web centric world.

* Create components in a framework agnostic way.
* Work with large Content Management Systems (CMS) and within Markdown.
* Leverage the Component architecture style of popular SPA frameworks and modern Javascript transpilers like TypeScript.
* Do not provide data binding natively (that's where your framework shines)
* Is cross browser compatible (Was created in 2011, but is now supported by all modern browsers)
* Provides quick component development, independent of a larger application.
* Can be created from [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/elements), [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([Preact](https://preactjs.com/) could be substituted) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) frameworks, but the output size and performance should be considered.
