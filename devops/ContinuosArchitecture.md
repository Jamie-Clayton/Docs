# Continuos Architectures

An operating model for architecture that moves away from design and implement approach (waterfall) to a continuous evolution via modern DevOps CICD using data driven architectural decisions and lean canvas concepts.

## Manifesto

The full manifesto details can be found at [Continuous Architecture Org](https://continuous-architecture.org/docs/manifest/manifesto.html)

1. We architect long term products, not just projects solutions.
2. We architect our products with a holistic view.
3. We prove (validate) the architecture by implementing it, not by validating document.
4. Architects shared the responsibility of the end-product; including its operability.
5. Architecture is a team activity and shared understanding, not a document that is passed down from a team to another.
6. Delay decisions until they are absolutely necessary.
7. Risk-driven prioritization: do customer-centric features with major architectural impact first.
